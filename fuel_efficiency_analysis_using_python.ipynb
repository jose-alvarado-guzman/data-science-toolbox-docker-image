This dataset contains fuel efficiency performance metrics, measured in miles per gallon (MPG) over time, for most makes and models of automobiles available in the U.S. since 1984. In addition to fuel efficiency attributes, this dataset also contains several other attributes of the vehicle listed, thereby providing the opportunity to summarize and group data to determine which makers or models tend to have better fuel efficiency historically and how this has changed over the years."

This can be accomplish by using the groupby and the agg functions of the Pandas Library to aggregate the observations by year, and then, for each group, compute the mean (by using the mean function of the Numpy Library) highway, city, and combine fuel efficiency.
